KMProgressCircle
================

This control is a simple circular progress indicator implemented in Swift. Check out the demo app to see how it works. It is adapted from a demo in a WWDC 2014 session on Interface Builder. I'm not sure how much more work will be done in this but I put in up in case any finds it useful.
